# First Extraction

The extraction chamber hums with residual energy as you step through the portal. Your first successful salvage run feels like a lifetime achievement. The scrap metal clinks in your collection unit - a meager beginning, but a beginning nonetheless.

The Caretaker's voice crackles over the comms: "Welcome to the club, rookie. Most don't make it past their first asteroid field. Your clone template shows promise."

You glance at your hands - still steady, still yours. For now.

The med-bay waits for no one, but today, you've earned your rest. Tomorrow, the void calls again.
