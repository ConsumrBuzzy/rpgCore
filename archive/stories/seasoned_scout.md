# Seasoned Scout

Five extractions. Five times you've danced with death in the asteroid fields and walked away. The other scouts call you "Lucky" behind your back, but you know better. It's not luck - it's the cold calculus of momentum and mass.

Your clone template has stabilized. The neural pathways are carving deeper grooves with each successful run. You're starting to remember things from previous clones - fragments of near-misses, the taste of emergency rations, the weight of scrap in your hands.

The Caretaker nods when you pass in the corridors. "You're becoming predictable," they say. "That's good. Predictable means you survive."

But you see something else in their eyes. Calculation. They're measuring you, weighing your value against the cost of your clones.

You push the thought away and check your gear. Another day, another extraction. The void doesn't care about your existential dread. It only cares about your mass.
