# Veteran Pilot

Ten extractions. The number hangs in your mind like a medal you didn't ask for. You've seen clones come and go - bright-eyed rookies who thought they could beat the odds, veterans who got careless, and too many who simply vanished in the chaos of high-velocity impacts.

Your hands move on their own now. The thrust calculations, the trajectory adjustments, the precise moment to cut engines - it's all muscle memory. You're not piloting the ship anymore; you're a ghost haunting a machine that remembers how to survive.

The Caretaker watches you from the observation deck. You can feel their gaze even when you're in the extraction zone. They're no longer just measuring your value; they're studying you. Learning your patterns.

Sometimes, in the quiet moments between runs, you wonder if you're still human or just a collection of successful behaviors wrapped in cloned flesh. The scrap you collect feels heavier each time, not because of its mass, but because of what it represents - another piece of your soul traded for survival.

The void doesn't care. And neither, it seems, do you.
