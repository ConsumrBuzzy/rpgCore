Engines Layer (Tier 2) - Core Game Engines

The main orchestration engines that drive game simulation:
- SyntheticRealityEngine: Cinematic orchestrator integrating all systems
- ChronosEngine: Time-based world evolution and progression
- D20Resolver: Deterministic D&D mechanics and rules
- SemanticResolver: Intent matching and semantic parsing
- NarrativeEngine: LLM-driven narration and storytelling
- PhysicsEngine: Physics simulation (2D/3D)
- RenderingEngine: Multi-modal rendering orchestration

Each engine can be used independently or composed together.

Depends on: game_engine.core, game_engine.foundation
